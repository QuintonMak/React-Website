            Wordle is a recently popular word game where the goal is to guess a secret 5-letter word in 6 or less tries. After each attempt, the letters of the guess will change color,
             providing information on the solution. <br> <br>
             If a character turns <strong style = "color: gray">grey</strong>, it is NOT in the solution. <br>
             If a character turns <strong style = "color: yellow">yellow</strong>, it is in the solution but in the wrong position. <br>
             If a character turns <strong style = "color: green">green</strong>, it is in the correct position. <br>
             In the case of duplicates, only as many of the character are in the solution, will get colored in. <br><br>
             Example One: Suppose the secret word is CLEAR, and suppose we guessed CRANE and TEETH <br>
             The result would look like: <br>
             <img src = "Images/clear.jpg">
             <br>
             N is grey as N is not in CLEAR. <br>
             A is yellow as it is in the 4th position in CLEAR, but the 3rd position in CRANE <br>
             C is green, as it is in the first position in both CLEAR and CRANE. <br>
             In TEETH, only one E is colored in as there is only one E in CLEAR. <br> <br>
             Example Two: Suppose the secret word is FUNNY, and we guessed CRANE and CANON. <br>
             The result would look like: <br>
             <img src = "Images/duplicates.jpg">
             <br>
             In CRANE, the one N is green as there is an N in the 4th position of FUNNY. But there can still be another N in the 3rd position. <br>
             In CANON, the first N is green as there is an N in the 3rd position of FUNNY. But the second N is yellow as there is another N in FUNNY, but it is in the 4th position. <br>
